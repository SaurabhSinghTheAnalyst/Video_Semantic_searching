# 🎉 Minimal Deployment Successful!

## ✅ What's Working

Your Video Semantic Search app is now deployed in **Minimal Mode** with these features:

### 🚀 **Core Functionality**
- ✅ **Video Upload**: Upload MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WMV, FLV files
- ✅ **Transcript Generation**: Automatic transcription using Deepgram API  
- ✅ **Video Library**: Organize and manage uploaded videos
- ✅ **File Management**: Metadata tracking and storage organization
- ✅ **Status Tracking**: Monitor upload and processing progress

### 📋 **How to Use**

1. **Set Up API Key**: Add your Deepgram API key in Streamlit Cloud secrets:
   ```toml
   [deepgram]
   DEEPGRAM_API_KEY = "your_deepgram_api_key_here"
   ```

2. **Upload Videos**: 
   - Use the sidebar file uploader
   - Add custom titles for your videos
   - Upload multiple files at once

3. **Process Videos**:
   - Click "🎬 Process" for each uploaded video
   - Wait for transcript generation to complete
   - View processing status in real-time

4. **Manage Library**:
   - View all uploaded videos in the library section
   - Track storage usage and processing status
   - Monitor video catalog

## 🔧 **What's Disabled**

- ❌ **Semantic Search**: No ML-powered search functionality
- ❌ **Video Analytics**: No advanced video content analysis  
- ❌ **Similarity Matching**: No content-based video discovery

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### Option 1: Use as Upload & Transcription Tool
Perfect for:
- Creating video transcript archives
- Processing video content for manual review
- Building a video library with metadata

### Option 2: Upgrade to Full Functionality Later
To enable search features, you would need to:
1. Add ML dependencies to `requirements.txt`
2. Configure embedding models
3. Set up vector database indexing

## 💡 **Benefits of Minimal Deployment**

- **⚡ Fast Loading**: No heavy ML model downloads
- **🛡️ Reliable**: Fewer dependencies = fewer potential issues  
- **💰 Cost Effective**: Lower resource usage on hosting platform
- **🔧 Maintainable**: Simpler codebase and troubleshooting

## 📊 **Performance Expectations**

- **Upload Speed**: Depends on file size and internet connection
- **Processing Time**: ~1-2 minutes per minute of video content
- **Storage**: Videos processed temporarily, transcripts saved permanently
- **Concurrent Users**: Should handle multiple users for upload/transcription

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### Transcript Generation Fails
- ✅ Check Deepgram API key in secrets
- ✅ Verify API quota and billing
- ✅ Try smaller video files first

### Upload Issues  
- ✅ Check file format (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WMV, FLV)
- ✅ Verify file size under Streamlit's limits
- ✅ Ensure stable internet connection

### App Performance
- ✅ Process videos one at a time for best results
- ✅ Clear browser cache if interface seems slow
- ✅ Check Streamlit Cloud app logs for errors

## 📈 **Usage Tips**

1. **Batch Processing**: Upload multiple videos, then process them sequentially
2. **File Naming**: Use descriptive filenames for better organization
3. **Custom Titles**: Add meaningful titles during upload for easier identification
4. **Storage Management**: Monitor the video library for storage usage
